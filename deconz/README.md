## Installation

The installation of this add-on is straightforward and easy to do.

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Hass.io** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "deCONZ" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

### Using a RaspBee

If your are using RaspBee, you may need to edit the `config.txt` file in the root
of your SD card in order for your RaspBee to be recognized and assigned a device name.

Add following to your `config.txt`:

```txt
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
```

### Configure the add-on

The add-on needs to know where your ConBee/RaspBee can be found, and therefore,
you'll need to configure the add-on to point to the right device.

If you're using Hass.io you may find the correct value for this on the
`Hass.io -> System -> Host system -> Hardware` page.

1. Replace **null** in the `device` option in the add-on configuration and specify
   the device name in quotes: (e.g. `"/dev/ttyUSB0"`, `"/dev/ttyAMA0"`, or `"/dev/ttyACM0"`).
2. Click on "SAVE" to save the add-on configuration.
3. Start the add-on.

After installing and starting this add-on, access the deCONZ WebUI ("Phoscon")
with "WEB UI" button.

## Configuring the Home Assistant deCONZ Component

By default, Home Assistant has the `discovery` component enabled, which
automatically discovers this add-on.

Navigate to **Configuration** -> **Integrations** page after starting this
add-on to configure the deCONZ component.

In case you don't have `discovery` enabled on your Home Assistant instance,
follow these instructions to configure the deCONZ component:

<https://home-assistant.io/components/deconz/>

## Migrating to this Add-on

To migrate deCONZ to Hass.io and this add-on, backup your deCONZ config via the
Phoscon WebUI, then restore that config after installing/reinstalling.

**_You must perform these steps or your Light, Group names and other data will be lost!_**

However, your ZigBee devices will remain paired to your ConBee or RaspBee hardware.

## Accessing the deCONZ application and viewing the mesh via VNC

The add-on allows you to access the underlying deCONZ application running on
a remote desktop via VNC. It allows you to view the ZigBee mesh (which can
be really helpful when debugging network issues), but also gives you access
to tons of advanced features.

To enable it:

- Set a port number for VNC in the "Network" configuration section of the
  add-on and hit "SAVE". Advised is to use port 5900, but any other port above
  5900 works as well.
- Set a VNC password in the add-on configuration and hit "SAVE".
- Restart the add-on.

To access it you need a [VNC Viewer][vnc-viewer] application.

If you are using macOS, you are in luck, since VNC is built-in. Open the
spotlight search and enter: `vnc://hassio.local:5900`

## Upgrading RaspBee and ConBee firmware

This add-on allows you to upgrade your firmware straight from the Phoscon
web interface with ease.

Go to "Settings -> Gateway" and click the upgrade button.

However, some USB sticks (like the Aeotec Z-Wave sticks), can interfere with
the upgrade process, causing the firmware upgrade to fail silently. If you end
up with the same firmware version as before you started the upgrade, consider
unplugging the other sticks and try again.

If that is still not working, try [upgrading the firmware manually][manual-upgrade].

## Advanced debug output control

Hidden controls are added to the add-on to allow control over the debug
output of deCONZ. The following options are hidden, but can be added to
the add-on configuration:

- `dbg_info`
- `dbg_aps`
- `dbg_otau`
- `dbg_zcl`
- `dbg_zdp`

These options require a number that represents the log level.

Example add-on config with `dbg_aps` enabled on log level 1:

```json
{
  "device": "/dev/ttyUSB0",
  "vnc_password": "",
  "dbg_aps": 1
}
```

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "device": "/dev/ttyAMA0"
}
```

### Option: `device` (required)

The device address of your ConBee/RaspBee.

If you're using Hass.io you may find the correct value for this on the
`Hass.io -> System -> Host system -> Hardware` page.

In most cases this is one of the following:

- `"/dev/ttyUSB0"`
- `"/dev/ttyAMA0"`
- `"/dev/ttyACM0"`

## Known issues and limitations

- Use at least 2.5A power supply for your Raspberry Pi!
  This avoids strange behavior when using this add-on.
